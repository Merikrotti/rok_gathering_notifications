# Rise of Kingdoms Gathering timer

A timer that calculates how much time it takes for you to gather and notifies you.

Live version in github.io; https://merikrotti.github.io/rok_gathering_notifications/

Incomplete. So is this readme.


## TODO

Save sessions. Implement "farming on territory" reduction and alliance speedups after that. Custom timers probably aswell if I will bother.

## I have an issue?

Open an issue on github and double check try to make it as comprehensive as possible.

## How are times calculated?

TODO

## How do I host my own?

There is a build branch, if you don't know how to, try to find information how to host html files. That is basic information and don't open an issue on it
